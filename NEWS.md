## Features

 * `kafka` (C implementation):
    * Added template support to `topic()`.

   ([#3372](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3372))

## Bugfixes

 * json-parser: fix parsing 64 bit numbers (currently 32 bit was a limit)
   ([#3403](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3403))
 * syslog-ng-ctl: when syslog-ng gets stuck on executing a heavy stats-ctl command, should be
   able to do a graceful shutdown when it is requested.
   ([#3349](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3349))
 * python: printing the exception instead of None (if compiled with clang)
   ([#3405](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3405))
