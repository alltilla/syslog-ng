## Highlights

<Fill this block manually from the blocks below>

## Features

 * `kafka` (C implementation):
    * Added template support to `topic()`.
    * Added `fallback-topic()` option, which will be used, if the templated `topic()` yields an invalid topic name.
   ([#3372](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3372))
 * systemd-journal: add namespace() option
   This option accepts a string which is identical to the `--namespace` option of journalctl.
   For systems defining this option with a `systemd` version older than `v245` a warning is issued.
   ([#3358](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3358))
 * `syslog-format`: accepting longer sdata keys
   
   Triggered by https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/issues/3197
   At the end of the discussion in the mentioned issue, we decided
   to change the parser and accept longer than 32 character ID's.
   ([#3244](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3244))

## Bugfixes

 * json-parser: fix parsing 64 bit numbers (currently 32 bit was a limit)
   ([#3403](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3403))
 * python: printing the exception instead of None (if compiled with clang)
   ([#3405](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3405))
 * syslog-ng-ctl: when syslog-ng gets stuck on executing a heavy stats-ctl command, should be
   able to do a graceful shutdown when it is requested.
   ([#3349](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3349))
 * `syslog-ng`: fixed numerous spelling mistakes in messages generated by syslog-ng
   ([#3398](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3398))
 * systemd-journal: add namespace to the persist name
   ([#3407](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3407))
 * afsocket: syslog-ng fails to bind() after config revert
   
   When having a program source or destination and a network destination in the
   config, if we reload with an invalid config, syslog-ng crashes, as it cannot init
   the old network source, because its address is in use.
   ([#3416](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3416))

## Other changes

 * json-parser: change every per message logs that was higher than debug to debug
   ([#3401](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3401))
