## Highlights

<Fill this block manually from the blocks below>

## Features

  * `syslog-parser()`: allow comma (e.g. ',') to separate the seconds and the fraction of a
    second part as some devices use that character. This change applies to both
    to syslog-parser() and the builtin syslog parsing functionality of network
    source drivers (e.g. udp(), tcp(), network() and syslog()).
    ([#3949](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3949))
  * `internal()`: add rcptid tag to all trace messages that relate to incoming
    log messages.  This makes it easier to correlate parsing, rewriting and
    routing actions with incoming log messages.
    ([#3972](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3972))
  * `dbld`: add support for Fedora 35 in favour of Fedora 33
    ([#3933](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3933))
  * `mariadb-audit-parser`: A new parser for mariadb/mysql audit plugin logs have been added. The parser supports the `syslog` output type's format, see [mariadb page](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-audit-plugin) for details.
    ([#3947](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3947))
  * `network()`, `syslog()` sources and destinations: added new TLS options `sigalgs()` and `client-sigalgs()`

    They can be used to restrict which signature/hash pairs can be used in digital signatures.
    It sets the "signature_algorithms" extension specified in RFC5246 and RFC8446.

    Example configuration:

    ```
    destination {
        network("test.host" port(4444) transport(tls)
            tls(
                pkcs12-file("/home/anno/Work/syslog-ng/tls/test.host.p12")
                peer-verify(yes)
                sigalgs("RSA-PSS+SHA256:ed25519")
            )
        );
    };
    ```
    ([#4000](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/4000))

## Bugfixes

  * `http()` and other threaded destinations: fix $SEQNUM processing so that
    only local messages get an associated $SEQNUM, just like normal
    syslog()-like destinations.  This avoids a [meta sequenceId="XXX"] SD-PARAM
    being added to $SDATA for non-local messages.
    ([#3928](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3928))
  * fix `threaded(no)` related crash: if threaded mode is disabled for
    asynchronous sources and destinations (all syslog-like drivers such as
    tcp/udp/syslog/network qualify), a use-after-free condition can happen due
    to a reference counting bug in the non-threaded code path.  The
    `threaded(yes)` setting has been the default since 3.6.1 so if you are using
    a more recent version, you are most probably unaffected.  If you are using
    `threaded(no)` a use-after-free condition happens as the connection closes.
    The problem is more likely to surface on 32 bit platforms due to pointer
    sizes and struct layouts where this causes a NULL pointer dereference.
    ([#3997](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3997))

## Other changes

  * `java()/python() destinations`: the $SEQNUM macro (and "seqnum" attribute in
    Python) was erroneously for both local and non-local logs, while it should
    have had a value only in case of local logs to match RFC5424 behavior
    (section 7.3.1).  This bug is now fixed, but that means that all non-local
    logs will have $SEQNUM set to zero from this version on, e.g.  the $SEQNUM
    macro would expand to an string, to match the syslog() driver behaviour.
